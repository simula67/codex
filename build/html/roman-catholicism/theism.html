<h1>Does God exist?<a class="headerlink" href="#does-god-exist" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Before asking the question “Does God Exist” we need to ask ourselves: “How can we know something?”</p>
<p>Most philosophers agree that there are 3 ways by which we can know something.</p>
<div class="section" id="inductive-reasoning">
<h2>Inductive reasoning<a class="headerlink" href="#inductive-reasoning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Inductive reasoning is reasoning based by probabilities. For example, if it is cloudy and winds are blowing fairly heavily, you can know that it is going to rain. However, this “knowledge” is not perfect, and it’s possible that it may not rain at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="deductive-reasoning">
<h2>Deductive reasoning<a class="headerlink" href="#deductive-reasoning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This reasoning is reasoning from premises to conclusions. For example,</p>
<p>Premise 1: all men are mortal.</p>
<p>Premise 2: Socrates is a man.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Socrates is mortal.</p>
<p>This argument is logically valid. If the premises are true the conclusion follows in an airtight manner. But, how can we know if the premises are true? We can know it through inductive reasoning. But once we know the premises, the probabilities from the premises flow to the conclusion in an airtight manner.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="abductive-reasoning">
<h2>Abductive reasoning<a class="headerlink" href="#abductive-reasoning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This method is reasoning to the simplest explanation. For example, if there is a glass of water in front of you it is possible that the water appeared out of thin air and glass formed around it. But the simpler explanation is that someone poured some water into that glass in front of you. Now, this form of reasoning is also a probabilistic, but it is based on a principle called Occam’s razor. This principle suggests that nature tries to simplify things.</p>
<p>All of these mechanisms can be used to deduce God’s existence.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="inductive-reasoning-towards-god">
<h2>Inductive reasoning towards God<a class="headerlink" href="#inductive-reasoning-towards-god" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any of the church approved Miracles helps you reason towards God. Now, church approved does not mean true. But it at least means some of the truly awful cons can be avoided by only limiting your investigation to them. Some examples may include</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Miracle of the Sun at Fatima</li>
<li>Incorruptible bodies of saints</li>
<li>Various miracles attributed to saints for canonization process etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is possible that all of them are fake, but given the fact that other scientists have looked at it skeptically and not found a naturalistic explanation suggests strongly that it may be of supernatural origin. This implies a strong probability that we are living in a theistic universe and not an atheistic one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="deductive-reasoning-towards-god">
<h2>Deductive reasoning towards God<a class="headerlink" href="#deductive-reasoning-towards-god" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many of the classical arguments for the existence of God deals with deductive reasoning. Some of these are mentioned in the book “Five proofs for the existence of God” by Edward Feser. I will mention one briefly here.</p>
<p>Consider a rubber ball. If it is heated it becomes a gooey substance. This is because the ball is potentially a gooey substance and that potential is actualized by heating. Now the heat itself is an actualization of a potential. Maybe the heat was produced by lighting some firewood. Now the firewood itself is producing heat right there is an actualization of a potential. The firewood was not there and it came there because someone cut down some tree carried it to some place where it can be set on fire and so on. We trace this back to the beginning and for something to happen this series needs to have a beginning. This is necessary because the potential by itself cannot produce an effect. For example, if you prod a stone with a stick it moves. The reason it moves is because you have moved it. If the stones moves it can be a deduced that you are at the other end of the stick and is moving it. However, if you simply tie another stick to the end of the stick, it cannot move the rock. If you keep tying it to infinity it will still not move the rock. However, if the rock moves it can be a certain that someone pushed it. Similarly the fact that the Universe exists and that it could could have failed to exist means that there must have been an entity that caused it and continues to sustain it. This entity is called God.</p>
<p>Once you come to accept this you understand the nature of God in the form of God’s divine attributes: his sentience, his perfect beauty etc. All of this is a result of omnipotence or the power to actualize all potentials.</p>

<div class="section" id="abductive-reasoning-towards-god">
<h2>Abductive reasoning towards God<a class="headerlink" href="#abductive-reasoning-towards-god" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This there are certain mathematical constants in the universe, that if they were outside a very narrow range, the universe would not exist. For example, during the Big Bang if the force with which the universe was expanding was off by even a tiniest of fractions, it would have collapsed on itself. Now, it is possible that there are multiple universes in this world, but the simpler explanation is that it was engineered by God.</p>
<p>Now, I have given you sufficient reason to believe in God, but at the end of the day you have to choose for yourself if the reasons are sufficient. If not, you have to go forward and seek more.</p>
<p>I hope you have understood by now that faith is choosing to believe in something through force of will in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Faith is not an irrational belief in something. For example, lets say that you invest some money in the bank. This bank has a good reputation and your family and friends have gotten good use out of the bank. As a result, you have come to put your faith in the bank. But if, one day you see people queing up before the bank and see that newspapers are reporting that the bank has failed and depositors have lost their money etc. you have enough reason to overturn your faith.</p>
