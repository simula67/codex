Roman Catholic Church
=====================

Since Jesus had founded the church with 11 men and one person at it's head, even in principle the Christian church can not have more than one leader. We know that the leader was Peter in Jesus' absence. And once Peter is gone someone else had to take his place. We establish historically that Peter came to Rome and he died at Rome. The first succession happened in Rome. It is possible that a future for Pope can reside in another city, but currently we can follow the current pope and his predecessors all the way back to Peter. This is why the Roman Catholic Church is the one true church. Now the rest of the ideas believed by Catholics follows from the authority afforded to the Roman Catholic Church through Peter.
