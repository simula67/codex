Divinity of Jesus Christ
========================

Christianity is true because Jesus Christ came back from the dead. I mean this quite literally. There was a man, his name was Jesus or Yeshua or Joshua. He died. By this, I mean his heart stopped beating, he stopped breathing and he stopped moving. Then three days later, he came back from the dead. This is not some sort of metaphor.

We can ascertain this fact by examining history. Most historians agree that on the historicity of Jesus Christ. Most historians also agree on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Historians, also agree that his followers became convinced that he cam back from the dead. It is very hard to explain the history of 1st century Palestine without Jesus resurrection.

1 Corinthians 15:3-7 talks about how 500 people saw him at the same time. It is believed that it was written just a few years after the death of Jesus and is considered by many to be historically reliable.

Liars make poor martyrs. Early Christians were thrown to their deaths and therefore it is unlikely that they were lying. It is difficult to reconcile the fact that many people rich, poor, powerful, powerless etc threw all of it away and went to their deaths claiming that Jesus Christ came back from the dead if they didn't really think this.

Again, it may be necessary to take a leap of faith. However, once you do, you can see that everything he talked about with respect to God is congruent with what we already know about God based on reason. Once you accept the divinity of Christ the concept of Trinity follows as he himself taught it and you become a Christian.
