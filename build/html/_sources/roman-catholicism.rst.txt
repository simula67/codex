Roman Catholicism
==================

I am going to frame this entire course through the Roman Catholic (or simply "Catholic") religion. We will learn about :doc:`frames <frames>` a little later. Catholic frame appears to be the best frame to view the world through since it has certain properties that leads to prosperity.

Let's begin by going through the basic structure of the Catholic religion.


The structure of the Catholic religion
--------------------------------------

There are 4 steps to being Catholic. These steps must be climbed one after the other in a sequential manner. These four steps can be understood in terms of questions. Answering "Yes" at each step allows you to climb to the next step. Here are the four steps: 

1. Does God exist? 

2. Are there three persons in that God? Did second person from that God become man in the form of Jesus Christ?

3. Did Jesus found a visible church?

4. Is that church the Roman Catholic Church?

If you answered yes to all these questions, congratulations, you are Catholic.

You will notice that each step above represents a transition from one form of belief system to another. Step 1 transitions you from atheism/agnosticism to theism. Step 2 transitions you to Christianity. Step 3 transitions you to Catholic churches (that is, Anglicanism/Eastern Orthodoxy/Oriental Orthodoxy/Roman Catholicism etc). Step 4 transitions you to Roman Catholicism. Now, let's examine each of these steps one by one.
