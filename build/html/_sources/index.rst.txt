Welcome to The Codex!
=================================

This project aims to help the consumer acquire a good chunk of the knowledge that is important but not usually taught in school.

Organization
------------

The material is arranged in a course like fashion. At any given point, when you find a fork in the road. You can take any path and ignore the remaining paths without affecting your learning process. However, before you go through `Topic A`, you need to go through all the topics that were presented before `Topic A`. This is because the material may build on previously introduced subjects.

Pre-requisites
--------------

You need to have a basic understanding of mathematics, language etc to follow this course. You should ideally have acquired these skills during your schooling. If you have a secondary school diploma, you should be able to take this course without issues.
