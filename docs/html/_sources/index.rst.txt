=================================

This project aims to help the reader develop an understanding of all the knowledge in the world.

Organization
------------

The material is arranged in a course like fashion and you need to go through them in a sequential order. An attempt is made to introduce all subjects you need to know to understand a more complex subject before the said complex subject. At any given point, you may find a fork in the road. You can take any path and ignore the remaining paths without affecting your learning process. 

Pre-requisites
--------------

You need to have a basic understanding of mathematics, language etc to follow this course. You should have acquired these skills during your schooling. If you have a secondary school diploma, you should be able to take this course without issues.
