Common methods of attack on the Roman Catholic religion
=======================================================

"We cannot prove God does not exist only to specifically discuss if Christianity is true"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember that the most important proof for Christianity is Jesus Christ coming back from the dead. So before asking the question "Is Christianity true, it is necessary to settle the question of naturalism". If you deny the supernatural under any conditions, and then if you ask for proof of Christianity effectively what you are attempting is to prove that Christianity is true given that it is false. There is only one way that can go: to falsehood.

"Faith and reason are opposed to each other"
--------------------------------------------

Since reason and application of reason in the form of science has prestige, it may be used as a mechanism to persuade you away from religion. However, faith and reason are mutually reinforcing. Your faith in human capacity for reason can lead to God. This can in turn strengthen your faith in reason since Jesus said he was the truth and reason is human intelligence applied in the pursuit of truth. This can in turn strengthen your faith in God. Eventually, this creates a virtuous cycle and can promote both.
