Founding of the church
=======================

It is clear from the gospels that Christ came to found a Church. He called the apostles, taught them directly and then sent them all over the world to preach the good news. He gave his life as ransom for many, saved humanity from our sins and then asked his disciples to spread this message to the whole world.

Jesus says in Matthew 16:18

"And I tell you, that you are Peter and on this rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven."
