Roman Catholicism
=================

I begin by going through the basic principles of the Roman Catholic religion. How does someone become a Catholic? There are 3 possible ways that someone can become Catholic :

1. Parents are Catholic or Family is Catholic

Some people are Catholic because their parents or their loved ones are Catholic and therefore they choose to be Catholic. People they love or people who love them being Catholic is a very powerful incentive for someone to be Catholic.

2. Beauty

Some people are Catholic because they are attracted to the beauty of the Catholic Church and there is a lot of beauty in the Catholic Church.

3. Charity

Some people are Catholic because they see all the charitable works that the Catholic Church produces and in their kindness decide to become Catholics.

It must be noted that no one method is inferior or superior to another. However, here we will only concern ourselves with the rational and reasonable mechanisms through which God draws us towards his Church.

The structure of the Catholic religion
--------------------------------------

There are 4 steps to becoming Catholic. These steps must be climbed one after another in a sequential manner, i.e, if you cannot climb Step 1, you should not go to Step 2. Trying to reason at Step 2 without first climbing Step 1 is folly and you should reconsider that decision.

The four steps can be understood in terms of four questions. Answering Yes at one step enables you to climb to the next step. Here are the four steps/questions :

Step 1: Does God exist?
Step 2: Are there 3 persons in that God? Did second person from that God become man in the form of Jesus Christ?
Step 3: Did Jesus found a Church?
Step 4: Is that Church the Roman Catholic Church?

If you ansswered "Yes" to all the questions above, congratulations, you are Catholic.

You will notice that the each step above represents a transition from one belief system to another. Step 1 transitions you from atheism/agnosticism to theism. Step 2 transitions you to Christianity. Step 3 transitions you to Catholic Churches (like Anglican, Easter Orthodox, Oriential Orthodox, Roman Catholic etc). Step 4 transitions you to Roman Catholicism.

Now, let us examine each step one by one.

Step 1: Does god exist?
-----------------------

To climb this step we must ask the question: how can we "know" something? Most philosophers agree that there are 3 ways by which we can know something :

1. Inductive reasoning

Inductive reasoning is based on probabilities. For example, if there is a lot of dark clouds and winds are blowing fairly heavily, you can "know" that it is going to rain. However, this "knowledge" is not perfect and it is possible that it may not rain at all.

2. Deductive reasoning

This is reasoning from premises to conclusions. For example:

Premise 1: All men are mortal
Premise 2: Socrates is a man

Conclusion: Socrates is mortal

This argument is logically valid. If the premises are true, the conclusion flows in an airtight manner. So how can we know if the premises are true? In this case, can know it through Inductive reasoning. But once we know the probabilities that the premises are true, the probabilities are transferred to the conclusion through deductive reasoning.

3. Abductive reasoning

This method is reasoning to the simplest conclusion. For example, if there is a glass of water in front of you, it is possible that the water appeared out of thin air and the glass formed around it. But the simpler explanation is that someone poured some waster into the glass now infront of you.

Now, this form of reasoning is also probabilistic, but it is based on a principle called Occam's Razor. This principle suggests that nature tries to simplify things.

These mechanisms can be used to demonstrate God's existance.


Inductively reasoning towards God
---------------------------------

Any of the Church approved miracles helps you to reason towards God. Using Church approved is important since many claimed miracles have later been proven to be fake. At least, when a miracle is approved by the Church, it means it has gone through some vetting. Some examples of these include:

1. Miracle of Sun at Fatima
2. Various miracles attributed to saint's intercession during canonization process
3. Incorruptible bodies of saints

etc

Of course it is possible that we may find there are naturalistic explanations for all these but since many have already been investigated and failed to be satisfactory explained, the balance of probability is that we are living in a theistic universe than an atheistic one.

Deductively reasoning towards God
---------------------------------

Many of the classical arguments for God's existence deals with deductively reasoning towards God. Here is Edward Feser making this argument :
