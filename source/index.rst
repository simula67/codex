Welcome to The Codex!
=================================

This project aims to help the consumer acquire all the knowledge that is usually not taught in school.

Organization
------------

The material is arranged in a course like fashion. At any given point, you may find a fork in the road. You can take any path and ignore the remaining paths without affecting your learning process. However, before you go through `Topic A`, you need to go through all the topics that was presented before `Topic A`. This is because the material may build on previously introduced subjects.

Pre-requisites
--------------

You need to have a basic understanding of mathematics, language etc to follow this course. You should ideally have acquired these skills during your schooling. If you have a secondary school diploma, you should be able to take this course without issues.

Let's go.
